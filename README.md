This project will develop Time series models to forecast the weekly sales of Walmart stores using historical sales data. This project aims to provide Walmart with a robust Time series model for sales forecasting, enabling better decision-making and resource allocation. The insights gained from this project could significantly improve the efficiency of inventory management and contribute to overall business success.
The potential client for this project could be the management team of Walmart, who want to forecast the weekly sales of different stores to help them to optimize their inventory management, logistics management and promotion strategy.
